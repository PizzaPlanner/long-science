[mod-setting-description]
long-science-exclude-basic-techs=If checked, essential techs (with fixed science cost) do not influence the multiplier
long-science-base-max-multiplier-override=The maximum multiplier. Allows going beyond the default maximum 1000x multiplier.
long-science-normal-multiplier=By how much each researched normal technology (with science pack cost) should affect the multiplier
long-science-trigger-multiplier=By how much each researched trigger technology should affect the multiplier
long-science-initial-multiplier=The starting multiplier without any technologies researched. This overrides the multiplier set at map creation.
long-science-ignore-level-bonus=By default, normal technologies with higher level have a lower multiplier (at the rate of normal multiplier / level).\nThis is intended to make techs like belt speed or inserter stack size more approachable.\nBy enabling this, multiplier is the same regardless of level.
